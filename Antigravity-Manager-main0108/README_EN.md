## 🌟 Detailed Feature Matrix

### 1. 🎛️ Smart Account Dashboard
*   **Global Real-time Monitoring**: Instant insight into the health of all accounts, including average remaining quotas for Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash, Claude, and Gemini Image generation.
*   **Smart Recommendation**: The system uses a real-time algorithm to filter and recommend the "Best Account" based on quota redundancy, supporting **one-click switching**.
*   **Active Account Snapshot**: Visually displays the specific quota percentage and the last synchronization time of the currently active account.

### 2. 🔐 Professional AI Account Management & Proxy System (v3.3.2)
*   **OAuth 2.0 Authorization (Auto/Manual)**: Pre-generates a copyable authorization URL so you can finish auth in any browser; after the callback, the app auto-completes and saves the account (use “I already authorized, continue” if needed).
*   **Multi-dimensional Import**: Supports single token entry, JSON batch import, and automatic hot migration from V1 legacy databases.
*   **Gateway-level Views**: Supports switching between "List" and "Grid" views. Provides 403 Forbidden detection, automatically marking and skipping accounts with permission anomalies.

### 3.  Protocol Conversion & Relay (API Proxy)
*   **Multi-Protocol Adaptation (Multi-Sink)**:
    *   **OpenAI Format**: Provides `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, compatible with 99% of existing AI apps.
    *   **Anthropic Format**: Provides native `/v1/messages` interface, supporting all features of **Claude Code CLI** (e.g., chain-of-thought, system prompts).
    *   **Gemini Format**: Supports direct calls from official Google AI SDKs.
*   **Smart Self-healing**: When a request encounters `429 (Too Many Requests)` or `401 (Expired)`, the backend triggers **millisecond-level automatic retry and silent rotation**, ensuring business continuity.

### 4. 🔀 Model Router Center
*   **Series-based Mapping**: Classify complex original model IDs into "Series Groups" (e.g., routing all GPT-4 requests uniformly to `gemini-3-pro-high`).
*   **Expert Redirection**: Supports custom regex-level model mapping for precise control over every request's landing model.
*   **Tiered Routing [New]**: Automatically prioritizes models based on account tiers (Ultra/Pro/Free) and reset frequencies to ensure stability for high-volume users.
*   **Silent Background Downgrading [New]**: Intelligently identifies background tasks (e.g., Claude CLI title generation) and reroutes them to Flash models to preserve premium quota.

### 5. 🎨 Multimodal & Imagen 3 Support
*   **Advanced Image Control**: Supports precise control over image generation tasks via OpenAI `size` (e.g., `1024x1024`, `16:9`) parameters or model name suffixes.
*   **Enhanced Payload Support**: The backend supports payloads up to **100MB**, more than enough for 4K HD image recognition and processing.

## 🔌 Quick Integration Examples

### 🔐 OAuth Authorization Flow (Add Account)
1. Go to `Accounts` → `Add Account` → `OAuth`.
2. The dialog pre-generates an authorization URL before you click any button. Click the URL to copy it to the system clipboard, then open it in the browser you prefer and complete authorization.
3. After consent, the browser opens a local callback page and shows “✅ Authorized successfully!”.
4. The app automatically continues the flow and saves the account; if it doesn’t, click “I already authorized, continue” to finish manually.

> Note: the auth URL contains a one-time local callback port. Always use the latest URL shown in the dialog. If the app isn’t running or the dialog is closed during auth, the browser may show `localhost refused connection`.

            - **Log Level Optimization**: Downgraded high-frequency debug logs for tool calls and parameter remapping from `info!` to `debug!`, dramatically reducing log output volume.
            - **Automatic Cleanup Mechanism**: Application startup now automatically cleans up log files older than 7 days, preventing indefinite log accumulation.
            - **Significant Impact**: Log file size reduced from 130GB/day to < 100MB/day, a **99.9%** reduction in log output.
            - **Scope**: Modified 21 log level statements in `streaming.rs` and `response.rs`, added `cleanup_old_logs()` automatic cleanup function.
    *   **v3.3.15 (2026-01-04)**:
        - **Claude Protocol Compatibility Enhancements** (Based on PR #296 by @karasungur + Issue #298 Fix):
            - **Fixed Opus 4.5 First Request Error (Issue #298)**: Extended signature pre-flight validation to all first-time thinking requests, not just function call scenarios. When using models like `claude-opus-4-5-thinking` for the first request, if there's no valid signature, the system automatically disables thinking mode to avoid API rejection, resolving the "Server disconnected without sending a response" error.
            - **Function Call Signature Validation (Issue #295)**: Added pre-flight signature validation. When thinking is enabled but function calls lack a valid signature, thinking is automatically disabled to prevent Gemini 3 Pro from rejecting requests.
            - **cache_control Cleanup (Issue #290)**: Implemented recursive deep cleanup to remove `cache_control` fields from all nested objects/arrays, resolving Anthropic API (z.ai mode) "Extra inputs are not permitted" errors.
            - **Tool Parameter Remapping**: Automatically corrects parameter names used by Gemini (Grep/Glob: `query` → `pattern`, Read: `path` → `file_path`), resolving Claude Code tool call validation errors.
            - **Configurable Safety Settings**: Added `GEMINI_SAFETY_THRESHOLD` environment variable supporting 5 safety levels (OFF/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/NONE), defaulting to OFF for backward compatibility.
            - **Effort Parameter Support**: Supports Claude API v2.0.67+ `output_config.effort` parameter, allowing fine-grained control over model reasoning effort.
            - **Opus 4.5 Default Thinking**: Aligned with Claude Code v2.0.67+, Opus 4.5 models now enable thinking mode by default, with signature validation for graceful degradation.
            - **Retry Jitter Optimization**: Added ±20% random jitter to all retry strategies to prevent thundering herd effect, improving stability in high-concurrency scenarios.
            - **Signature Capture Improvement**: Immediately captures signatures from thinking blocks, reducing signature missing errors in multi-turn conversations.
            - **Impact**: These improvements significantly enhance compatibility and stability for Claude Code, Cursor, Cherry Studio and other clients, especially in Opus 4.5 models, tool calling, and multi-turn conversation scenarios.
    *   **v3.3.14 (2026-01-03)**:
        - **Claude Protocol Robustness Improvements** (Core Thanks to @karasungur PR #289):
            - **Thinking Block Signature Validation Enhancement**:
                - Support for empty thinking blocks with valid signatures (trailing signature scenario)
                - Invalid signature blocks gracefully degrade to text instead of being dropped, preserving content to avoid data loss
                - Enhanced debugging logs for signature issue troubleshooting
            - **Tool/Function Calling Compatibility Optimization**:
                - Extracted web search fallback model to named constant `WEB_SEARCH_FALLBACK_MODEL` for improved maintainability
                - Automatically skips googleSearch injection when MCP tools are present to avoid conflicts
                - Added informative logging for debugging tool calling scenarios
                - **Important Note**: Gemini Internal API does not support mixing `functionDeclarations` and `googleSearch`
            - **SSE Parse Error Recovery Mechanism**:
                - Added `parse_error_count` and `last_valid_state` tracking for streaming response error monitoring
                - Implemented `handle_parse_error()` for graceful stream degradation
                - Implemented `reset_error_state()` for post-error recovery
                - Implemented `get_error_count()` for error count retrieval
                - High error rate warning system (>5 errors) for operational monitoring
                - Detailed debugging logs supporting troubleshooting of corrupted streams
            - **Impact**: These improvements significantly enhance stability for Claude CLI, Cursor, Cherry Studio and other clients, especially in multi-turn conversations, tool calling, and streaming response scenarios.
        - **Dashboard Statistics Fix** (Core Thanks to @yinjianhong22-design PR #285):
            - **Fixed Low Quota Statistics False Positives**: Fixed the issue where disabled accounts (403 status) were incorrectly counted in "Low Quota" statistics
            - **Logic Optimization**: Added `is_forbidden` check in `lowQuotaCount` filter to exclude disabled accounts
            - **Data Accuracy Improvement**: Dashboard now accurately reflects the true number of low-quota active accounts, avoiding false positives
            - **Impact**: Improved dashboard data accuracy and user experience, allowing users to more clearly understand which accounts need attention.
    *   **v3.3.13 (2026-01-03)**:
        - **Thinking Mode Stability Fixes**:
            - **Fixed Empty Thinking Content Error**: When clients send empty Thinking blocks, they are now automatically downgraded to plain text blocks to avoid `thinking: Field required` errors.
            - **Fixed Validation Error After Smart Downgrade**: When Thinking is disabled via smart downgrade (e.g., incompatible history), all Thinking blocks in historical messages are automatically converted to plain text, resolving "thinking is disabled but message contains thinking" errors.
            - **Fixed Model Switching Signature Error**: Added target model Thinking support detection. When switching from Claude thinking models to regular Gemini models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`), Thinking is automatically disabled and historical messages are downgraded to avoid "Corrupted thought signature" errors. Only models with `-thinking` suffix (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-thinking`) or Claude models support Thinking.
            - **Impact**: These fixes ensure stability across various model switching scenarios, especially for seamless Claude ↔ Gemini transitions.
        - **Account Rotation Rate-Limiting Mechanism Optimization (Critical Fix for Issue #278)**:
            - **Fixed Rate-Limit Time Parsing Failure**: Completely resolved the issue where Google API's `quotaResetDelay` could not be correctly parsed.
                - **Corrected JSON Parsing Path**: Fixed the extraction path for `quotaResetDelay` from `details[0].quotaResetDelay` to `details[0].metadata.quotaResetDelay`, matching Google API's actual JSON structure.
                - **Implemented Universal Time Parsing**: Added `parse_duration_string()` function to support parsing all time formats returned by Google API, including complex combinations like `"2h21m25.831582438s"`, `"1h30m"`, `"5m"`, `"30s"`, etc.
                - **Differentiated Rate-Limit Types**: Added `RateLimitReason` enum to distinguish between `QUOTA_EXHAUSTED` (quota exhausted) and `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (rate limit) types, setting different default wait times based on type (quota exhausted: 1 hour, rate limit: 30 seconds).
            - **Problem Before Fix**: When account quota was exhausted triggering 429 errors, the system could not parse the accurate reset time returned by Google API (e.g., `"2h21m25s"`), resulting in using a fixed default value of 60 seconds. Accounts were incorrectly considered "recoverable in 1 minute" when they actually needed 2 hours, causing accounts to fall into a 429 loop, using only the first 2 accounts while subsequent accounts were never utilized.
            - **Effect After Fix**: The system can now accurately parse the reset time returned by Google API (e.g., `"2h21m25.831582438s"` → 8485 seconds). Accounts are correctly marked as rate-limited and wait for the accurate time, ensuring all accounts can be properly rotated and used, completely resolving the "only using first 2 accounts" issue.
            - **Impact**: This fix significantly improves stability and availability in multi-account environments, ensuring all accounts are fully utilized and avoiding account rotation failures caused by rate-limit time parsing errors.
    *   **v3.3.12 (2026-01-02)**:
        - **Critical Fixes**:
            - **Fix Antigravity Thinking Signature Errors**: Completely resolved `400: thinking.signature: Field required` errors when using the Antigravity (Google API) channel.
                - **Disabled Dummy Thinking Block Injection**: Removed logic that auto-injected unsigned "Thinking..." placeholder blocks for historical messages. Google API rejects any thinking blocks without valid signatures.
                - **Removed Fake Signature Fallback**: Removed logic that added `skip_thought_signature_validator` sentinel values to ToolUse and Thinking blocks. Now only uses real signatures or omits the thoughtSignature field entirely.
                - **Fixed Background Task Misclassification**: Removed the "Caveat: The messages below were generated" keyword to prevent normal requests containing Claude Desktop system prompts from being misclassified as background tasks and downgraded to Flash Lite models.
                - **Impact**: This fix ensures stability for Claude CLI, Cursor, Cherry Studio, and other clients when using the Antigravity proxy, especially in multi-turn conversations and tool calling scenarios.
    *   **v3.3.11 (2026-01-02)**:
        - **Critical Fixes**:
            - **Cherry Studio Compatibility Fix (Gemini 3)**:
                - **Removed Forced Prompt Injection**: Removed the mandatory "Coding Agent" system instruction and Gemini 3 user message suffix injections. This resolves the issue where `gemini-3-flash` would output confused responses (like "Thinking Process" or "Actually, the instruction says...") in general-purpose clients like Cherry Studio. The generic OpenAI protocol now respects the original user prompt faithfully.
            - **Fix Gemini 3 Python Client Crash**:
                - **Removed maxOutputTokens Restriction**: Removed the logic that forcibly set `maxOutputTokens: 64000` for Gemini requests. This forced setting caused standard Gemini 3 Flash/Pro models (limit 8192) to reject requests and return empty responses, triggering `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'` errors in Python clients. The proxy now defaults to the model's native limit or respects client parameters.
        - **Core Optimization**:
            - **Unified Retry Backoff System**: Refactored error retry logic with intelligent backoff strategies tailored to different error types:
                - **Thinking Signature Failure (400)**: Fixed 200ms delay before retry, avoiding request doubling from immediate retries.
                - **Server Overload (529/503)**: Exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s/8s), significantly improving recovery success rate by 167%.
                - **Rate Limiting (429)**: Prioritizes server-provided Retry-After, otherwise uses linear backoff (1s/2s/3s).
                - **Account Protection**: Server-side errors (529/503) no longer rotate accounts, preventing healthy account pool contamination.
                - **Unified Logging**: All backoff operations use ⏱️ identifier for easy monitoring and debugging.
        - **Critical Fix**:
            - **Fixed Gemini 3 Python Client Crash**: Removed the logic that forced `maxOutputTokens: 64000` for Gemini requests. This override caused standard Gemini 3 Flash/Pro models (limit 8192) to reject requests with empty responses, leading to `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'` errors in Python clients. The proxy now defaults to model native limits or respects client parameters.
        - **Scoop Installation Compatibility Support (Core Thanks to @Small-Ku PR #252)**:
            - **Startup Arguments Configuration**: Added Antigravity startup arguments configuration feature. Users can now customize startup parameters in the Settings page, perfectly compatible with portable installations via package managers like Scoop.
            - **Smart Database Path Detection**: Optimized database path detection logic with priority-based checking:
                - Command-line specified `--user-data-dir` path
                - Portable mode `data/user-data` directory
                - System default paths (macOS/Windows/Linux)
            - **Multi-Installation Support**: Ensures correct database file location and access across standard installations, Scoop portable installations, and custom data directory scenarios.
        - **Browser Environment CORS Support Optimization (Core Thanks to @marovole PR #223)**:
            - **Explicit HTTP Method List**: Changed CORS middleware `allow_methods` from generic `Any` to explicit method list (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/HEAD/OPTIONS/PATCH), improving browser environment compatibility.
            - **Preflight Cache Optimization**: Added `max_age(3600)` configuration to cache CORS preflight requests for 1 hour, reducing unnecessary OPTIONS requests and improving performance.
            - **Security Enhancement**: Added `allow_credentials(false)` configuration, following security best practices when used with `allow_origin(Any)`.
            - **Browser Client Support**: Enhanced CORS support for browser-based AI clients like Droid, ensuring cross-origin API calls work properly.
        - **Account Table Drag-and-Drop Sorting (Core Thanks to @wanglei8888 PR #256)**:
            - **Drag to Reorder**: Added drag-and-drop sorting functionality for the account table. Users can now customize account display order by dragging table rows, making it easy to pin frequently used accounts to the top.
            - **Persistent Storage**: Custom sort order is automatically saved locally and persists across application restarts.
            - **Optimistic Updates**: Drag operations update the interface immediately for smooth user experience, while saving asynchronously in the background.
            - **Built with dnd-kit**: Implemented using the modern `@dnd-kit` library, supporting keyboard navigation and accessibility features.
    *   **v3.3.10 (2026-01-01)**:
        - 🌐 **Upstream Endpoint Fallback Mechanism** (Core Thanks to @karasungur PR #243):
            - **Multi-Endpoint Auto-Switching**: Implemented `prod → daily` dual-endpoint fallback strategy. Automatically switches to backup endpoint when primary returns 404/429/5xx, significantly improving service availability.
